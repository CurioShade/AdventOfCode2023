# Quick Overview

This repository contains some of the solutions for the Advent Of Code 2023 written in Elixir (which was made as a challenge inspired by ![Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGJPLh7O2iI)).

While original time for the Advent of Code 2023 is long gone, I kept publishing new solutions and it's very likely there will be more in the future.
